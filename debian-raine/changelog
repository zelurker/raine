raine (0.51.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Find the changes in git !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 15 Dec 2011 20:56:10 +0100

raine (0.51.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version mainly adds support to save the state of fm sound chips
    (music) in savegames and restore them correctly, 

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 15 Dec 2011 20:49:19 +0100

raine (0.51.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Binary build of the git sources. Changes include tharrier finally fully
    playable, a few fixes for the debugger, and removal of some sound warning
    messages.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 23 Dec 2009 09:15:14 +0100

raine (0.51.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Loading a savegame with the gui now correctly sets the savegame slot, so
    that using f2 to save after this saves to the correct slot.
  * The font keeps a constant size in windows (previously in low resolutions
    simply pressing esc on the main menu was resizing the font !).
  * the ingame texts (hud) can be made optionally opaque from the gui

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 02 Sep 2009 11:17:41 +0200

raine (0.51.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the bad display of initial screen when using a low resolution in ms
    windows
  * console: After 100 traces (step, next, etc...), we had a very nice buffer
    overflow. It's fixed now...
  * F3 now displays wether the save slot is free or the date and time of the
    savegame if it's already used (default key for next save slot)
  * Now the console calls automatically m68kdis when it needs disassembling.
    It has a cache system to keep the process very fast, and it's much more
    convinient than calling it manually from outside raine.
  * When running a game from the command line in fullscreen with yuv overlays
    enabled, windows was producing a very psychadelic screen at start, which
    could crash some systems (vista...). It's now fixed (windows specific).
  * double buffer : the option gets a new setting in the video option dialog :
    "Even with overlays" to force double buffer when using yuv overlays. The
    default in the previous versions was to force double buffer as much as
    possible, but it was producing some bad things with overlays on some
    setups (screen flickering, emulation slowing down...). So unless you
    absolutely want to force double buffer, leave this option on its default
    value: "when possible", it should improve yuv overlays.

raine (0.51.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reset game in "Game Options" in the gui now immediately returns to the
    game
  * The font size is checked every time the video mode changes now, which
    avoids a glitch where the dialogs might be unreadable after changing the
    video mode.
  * Improvements to the gui, fixes some display bugs, and the file/dir
    selector gains a title.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 26 Mar 2009 10:00:44 +0100

raine (0.51.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug which got unnoticed for a very long time in the cave driver
    related to synchronization between sprites and bg layers (apparently it
    was here since 0.50.6).
  * cps1 : reset the video priorities when loading a new game. Before that if
    you loaded 1941 after varth, you got some very weird video priorities in
    1941 (sprites partially hidden).
  * Loading a savegame from the gui now automatically returns to game (for
    neoraine too).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 20 Mar 2009 22:49:05 +0100

raine (0.51.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a buffer overflow in the cave driver which has been here for a very
    long time, except that it didn't crash anything before version 0.51.0, and
    now it suddenly crashes raine on guwange title screen !
  * Loading a 2nd game works again as before (a change in the gui for 0.51.1
    made this quite special !).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 14 Mar 2009 21:51:50 +0100

raine (0.51.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * emudx dir, artwork dir and screenshots dir becomes configurable via the
    gui, from "Options" in the main menu.
  * Fixed hq2x/3x but in 16bpp this time. This produced a crash when trying to
    enable hq2x/3x after loading a game in any win32 fullscreen mode, and the
    left part of the bitmap was missing like the previous bug for 32bpp... oh
    well at least it shows there are really not enough people reporting bugs
    in win32... !
  * Fixed a crash in the autofire dialog for games which don't map an input
    with "button" in its name (like aquajack).
  * Aqua jack is now in the partially working game, because it freezes before
    the boss in the 2nd level.
  * Include the patch from Gelide project to have the "-fs" command line
    argument to toggle fullscreen !
  * All the games using a 6502 were broken in 0.51.0 because of the changes to
    make everything optional in the compilation. Fixed now.
  * Bezels are now correctly displayed when using scanlines : double
    height+double width.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 13 Mar 2009 23:08:49 +0100

raine (0.51.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade cps1 & cps2 romsets to finally be compatible with mame (I took the
    0.129 sources). In the process I adapted the video config to use the
    amazing work they did in dumping all these video chips which were the
    causes of all the kludges which have been in the cps1/cps2 emulation
    during all these years. So in clear there is a possibility that some
    drivers are broken, because I can't test them all obviously, but I'll try
    my best to avoid obvious bugs.
     - It's around 210 more clones to play with
     - this time the game genre is taken from maws instead of being "misc"
    everywhere (for cps1 & cps2)
     - Use less ram for most drivers
     - emulation slightly faster for cps1 sprites, and slightly better for
    cps2 (I don't really call this bug fixes, but...).
  * If you tried to use the gui to rotate the screen in the middle of playing
    then you were very likely to get a crash if the game used priority bitmaps
    (like all cps1/cps2 games !!!). It's fixed now, you can rotate the screen
    whenever you want, the priority bitmap will survive !
  * Various bugs fixed for the console again...
  * When switching to fullscreen and you have not asked to set the video mode
    from the game resolution in the gui, the resolution taken is now the
    desktop's resolution. It makes much more sense than switching a 22'' lcd
    screen to 640x480 just because the window size was 640x480 and we switched
    to fullscreen. Also when returning from fullscreen the previous size of
    the window is correctly restored even if you restarted raine before
    returning to windowed mode.
  * You can now compile raine from a 64 bit environment. Actually it is very
    easy to do, and I should have done it earlier, it's just about using the
    -m32 gcc switch. Just make sure you have the 32 bit version of all the
    libraries needed. I just updated the guide about how to compile raine.
    The detection is now automatic, you just have to launch make without
     parameters.
  * Finally add a dialog to configure the rom directories, you can access it
    from Change Game/Options (1st line of the game list). By the way, rom
    directories become unlimited. A friend of mine asked this feature about 2
    years ago... Oh well he didn't know I had planned to rewrite completely
    the gui before doing that ! ;-)
  * GUI : try to choose a better font size when displaying dialogs
  * cheats : if there are no cheats for the current game, and there are some
    for the parent, then load the cheats of the parent. It allows to have
    cheats for the 210 new clones, and it's very likely that they will be all
    correct (and anyway it's better than nothing !).
  * Raine and neoraine finally share the same makefile. To compile neoraine,
    you must uncomment the line "NEO=1" at the top of the makefile, or you can
    type as before "make -f makefile.neocd" which now includes the normal
    makefile.
  * Misc bugs fixed, for example a memory leak in the taito f3 sound emulation
    was suddenly found because the link order made it to crash the program.

raine (0.50.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closing the window of the emulator doesn't trigger a segfault anymore
    (well the segfault was quiting too, but in windows this was producing a
    ugly error message, so it's better now !)
  * Fixed a stupid bug in the "next" console command
  * The video options dialog shows only the options for yuv overlay when in
    autodetect mode since overlays are the default, you must now choose
    explicitely "force normal blits" to see the scalers/scanlines options.
  * Double buffer is forced even when using yuv overlays in fullscreen mode in
    windows. Normaly video synchronization should be handled by overlays but
    since it's very messy to configure, it's probably better to force it here.
    If your overlays correctly handle video sync, then you can disable double
    buffer in the video options to trust your overlays.
  * Fixed a tremendous bug in hq3x/32bpp and hq2x/32bpp, the left part of the
    game bitmap was cut.
  * Fixed a crash when switching to hq3x in the middle of a game
  * Darwin (mac os x) becomes an "experimental" target. Neoraine can be built
    for it, and raine can be built only if not too many drivers are compiled
    in! This thing makes me nuts, its linker is completely crazy. Anyway there
    is now a new tool for building light version of raine : scan_drivers.pl
    in games, which allows to choose which game drivers you want to include.
    Once you have chosen, it includes the required cpu emulators/sound
    drivers. It might be usefull when building for small systems...

raine (0.50.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mike (dx) noticed donkey kong had some pink pixels around him in emudx
    mode, so we fixed them, now it looks better.
  * 1st boss of ninja warrior was freezing the game since raine 0.41, very old
    bug, fixed too.
  * Remember the video priority fix for cps2 in 0.50.13 ? Well, it wasn't
    perfect, there was at least 1 game which didn't like it : 1944, in the end
    of the 1st stage, some boats looked like some submarines with this fix. So
    I had to do a better fix, hopefully this time it works everywhere...
  * When loading a game failed (and a game was previously loaded), the gui
    crashed just after displaying the error message (when a rom was not found
    for example).
  * There was a very old bug in mshh : if black heart appears, the game resets
    while he is making his entrance. It was a very weird bug because of an
    optimization in starscream - worked around it, now it finally works !
    (mshu was already working).
  * Be sure to exit with a return code of 0 for the stupid verbosity of vista
    which seems to complain when a program does not so.

raine (0.50.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with the joysticks where if you moved the stick too fast, some
    opposite directions could be rejected (left after right...).
  * Fixed a segfault while trying to access the analog calibration dialog.
  * Preliminary support for darwin (mac os x), but the linker seems to do some
    weird stuff and for now it crashes at startup even before reaching the
    main function !!!
  * Thanks to Logiqx you can now load correctly the bootleg version of new
    zealand story.
  * Added a few things to the console, required to have better cheats for
    ssrpg (neoraine)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 08 Aug 2008 00:21:42 +0200

raine (0.50.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a problem with the drawing of some big sprites in the toaplan2
    driver (not all of them, just some of them with a middle symetry, like
    with the 1st boss in the demo of dogyuun for example !). Very old
    bug.
  * Took this opportunity to add basic sound support to kbash, fixeight and
    batsugun from the findings by mame in the toaplan2 driver (very basic
    sound anyway).
    Also I enabled sound for dogyuun but since I don't know which sound maps
    to what it's more noise than sound effects for some parts, anyway it's
    still better than silence, and turn sound off if you don't like it !
    It works also for vfive/grindstm but I had to make it a clone of dogyuun
    to be able to borrow dogyuun's samples.
  * Added kbash2, a bootleg with a better sound support than kbash !
  * Fixed the sound in finalttr (it probably never worked before past the 1st
    screen!)
  * Finally made the animations of the cave sprites more smooth when they are
    zoomed in or out (previously it was an approximation which showed
    specially in mazinger, now the animations are much better).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 26 Jun 2008 10:18:25 +0200

raine (0.50.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * us classic golf (seta game) finally works correctly. In fact it never
    worked, even in 0.43.0 it had bad colors, the set now requires the color
    proms for good colors, so you might have to upgrade to romset.
  * cps2: fixed a priority problem in nwarr when taking Anakaris. It was a
    stupid mistake, but which went unnoticed for a very long time ! so the fix
    affects every cps2 game, but AFAIK it was noticeable only in this game...
  * gui: game selection was partially broken in previous version
  * gui: changing a menu value with the mouse didn't work well in previous
    version (you had to use the keyboard for that !).
  * The 8bpp games are working correctly when using normal blits, + the
    palette updates are now more efficient (it's still less efficient than the
    normal games, but it's better).
  * The console isn't anymore a bag of bugs and becomes usable, you can now
    create scripts, and execute them from the cheats dialog (which gained a 
    keyboard shortcut in the process - alt-c by default, change it if you
    already use alt !). I have added some basic cheats using the console for
    ironclad, mslug and ssrpg. If you are interested, read the topics on
    rainemu forum about the console, and see the integrated help (help
    command).

raine (0.50.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * A better fix for the problem in the cave driver, and this time I found and
    fixed a bug with disappearing sounds. It was most noticeable with guwange,
    after a while you didn't hear your own shots anymore !
  * fix 8bpp mode (when launching raine on an 8bpp desktop), broken in many
    places (crashes, palette, etc...).
  * There was a possibility of crash when reseting a game with f1 and sound
    was playing.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 05 Apr 2008 22:20:43 +0200

raine (0.50.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed an irq problem in the cave driver which was freezing esprade at the
    1st boss. The cause is the new version of starscream which is more precise
    with interrupts, I even wonder how the cave driver could work the way it
    was before that... anyway it's fixed, but it could happen in some other
    raine games (luckily very few drivers have a complicated interrupt system
    like the cave driver).
  * The recent gui changes could make some part of the gui to remain visible
    after a game had been started... lack of tests here, sorry !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 14 Mar 2008 23:17:43 +0100

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 13 Mar 2008 17:45:10 +0100

raine (0.50.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quite a few fixes while debuging neoraine : inputs, normal blits,
    scanlines, pixel double, and a few others... See neoraine 1.1.1 changelog
    for version 1.1.1

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue, 11 Mar 2008 20:14:21 +0100

raine (0.50.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * There was an endianess detection problem in mingw32 since the new savegame
    format was added in 0.43.4b. The consequence : savegames were incompatible
    between linux and windows. I have fixed this, and added some code to
    detect this bug to allow to load the broken savegames in linux...
  * history.dat : now handles correctly the long url at start of each entry
    (avoid a crash)
  * The screenshots directory isn't hardcoded anymore in the sources for the
    game selection dialog (uses the the screen_dir setting of the config file)
  * You can finally change the keys for the video layers, just load a game
    which uses video layers and then go to the inputs section / Video
    layers... (notice that some games must be started before you can configure
    the layers, like the cave games).
  * Inputs are now reseted when returning to the game, which avoids the
    problems when calling the gui while keeping a game key pressed.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 06 Mar 2008 11:21:01 +0100

raine (0.50.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * fullheight scanlines + double width are back from the allegro version,
    it's a new choice of scanlines in video options
  * Took back the "pixel double" scaler from the allegro version too. You can
    now choose the kind of scaling you want if you force normal blits in video
    options.
  * Added hq2x and hq3x scalers in MMX versions only.

raine (0.50.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * when choosing video mode change -> low resolution with scale2x enabled,
    you were very likely to triger a crash, it's now fixed.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 05 Jan 2008 11:53:15 +0100

raine (0.50.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the about dialog (showing it 2 times corrupted the line about the
    sdl versions), and improves handling of corrupted savegames

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 03 Jan 2008 23:53:06 +0100

raine (0.50.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add history.dat to the binary package. It's used also by neoraine and I am
    sure noone installs it by hand so it's better to put it inside...

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 28 Dec 2007 21:42:52 +0100

raine (0.50.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed puzznic crashing when trying to change the dipswitches (extremely
    old bug reported by Stephh)
  * starscream is upgraded to 0.26d, while still keeping the changes for
    raine...
  * it was impossible to revert to windowed mode by using the fullscreen
    command of the gui in windows
  * When a game had a few regions available + some cheats, the cheats were
    loaded again at the end of the currently loaded ones every time the region
    was changed !!! With this behaviour it was very easy to crash !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 27 Dec 2007 00:13:31 +0100

raine (0.50.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes pulirula which could not be loaded, and add the long forgoten
    rotating layer to it - still some video priorities problems, but they
    would require a priority bitmap to be fixed, and it would be too much
    trouble to add this to the taito_f2 driver for now...
    By the way, pulirulj (the japenese set) is removed and replaced by a
    romswitch to select the country.
  * The gui controls which used some modifiers were trigered when pressing the
    key alone (ie pressing ENTER was trigering the control CTRL+Enter to
    switch fullscreen mode).
  * Hiscores are now preserved when loading a savegame (which allows to load
    old savegames without trashing the hiscores). Be carefull though, it works
    only for the games which use hiscore.dat, it doesn't work for the ones
    which use an eprom for their scores (like battle bakraid for example).
  * Scanlines :
     - Fixed a buffer overflow for fullheight scanlines when the video
     resolution is bigger than the game screen * 2
     - Fixed updates of the video screen when using scanlines on a double
     buffered screen (which is usually the case in ms windows fullscreen
     modes)
     - Changed the video options dialog to display scanlines options only when
     not using overlays. Scanlines can't work with overlays because they
     require lines with a height of exactly 1 pixel, which is impossible to
     achieve with overlays. You have to explicitly force normal blits if you
     really want to have scanlines and your video hardware supports overlays.

raine (0.50.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * bezel improvements :
    - fixed the locale problem (linux only ?), now bezels aren't affected
    anymore by the locale
    - when using yuv overlays and bezels, the bezel size is taken into account
    when choosing the size of the game screen (the bezel was cut previously).
    - Now redraw correctly the bezel on the game window when it needs to be
    redrawn (previously you needed to return to the raine menu and back to the
    game to force the bezel to be redrawn).
    - Fixed the 24bpp bitmaps (instead of 32) for the bezels, and the 8bpp
    bitmaps used for some masks (it allows pacman style bezels to work
    correctly now)
    - Fixed the mmx causing problems when trying to load a bezel with an emudx
    game using alpha blending.
    - Fixed horizontal bezels (they never worked, but since I could find only
    the one for superman which is horizontal, it probably went unnoticed !).
  * Prevent a crash when a game loading function aborts (like when trying to
    load msh).
  * Fixed bad loading of warrior blade (this one uses a bezel to fix the
    extreme aspect ratio of this double screen game).
  * The autofire is coming back in an improved form : once you have enabled
    autofire for an input, the "Autofire controls" will be available in the
    menu, which allows you to choose a different key for autofire (which can
    be usefull for games which have a charge mode - I got the idea from the
    ps2 version of gunbird !).
  * Add joysticks'hat support in windows : this should allow the gamepads
    which didn't work in windows to be recognized now (the hats are what we
    usually call the cross on a gamepad - it's mapped as a new virtual stick
    on the joystick now). Notice that it's windows specific, linux already
    maps the hats to virtual sticks at the driver level, which means that no
    hat support is required in linux.
  * Fix mouse handling in bshark, opwolf, spacegun and syvalion
  * Fixed changing mouse buttons assignement in the gui (Inputs), it was
    cycling and assigning the wrong button...
  * Analog controls support : now you can select which device you want to use
    as an analog device from the gui, in the inputs section, and even
    calibrate it (usefull for some devices like the pedals of the gran turismo
    steering wheel !). This device is automaticaly used if configured in
    chasehq, night striker, continental circus and space gun (no more fake
    dipswitches for chasehq).

raine (0.50.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for a frogger hack which adds hiscore table, see
    http://www.jrok.com/sohs/frogger/frogger.html
    The rom should be renamed as froggs.zip.
    The permanent ram is saved on disk, no hiscore.dat update required.
    Emudx support works also for this one (it doesn't change anything in the
    game).
  * A little fix for the hiscores : They were loaded too late to be shown on
    the first screen of dkong (it starts by the hiscore table). So they are
    now loaded at the begining of the emulation and you see correctly the
    hiscore table in dkong now.
  * The cheats.cfg file now supports a new syntax for clones with the same
    cheats, it makes the file 1/3 smaller (why didn't we do that earlier ???)
  * Added donkey kong foundry (dkongex) :
    http://www.jeffsromhack.com/products/donkeykong.htm
  * Linux: Fixed fbcon support when using a driver which allows to change the
    video mode like matroxfb or nvidiafb : these drivers require a special
    handling in sdl to avoid a crash. Advice : use 16bpp at least for fbcon if
    you want to use raine with that, or expect a strange looking gui...
  * Added galaxian, super galaxian, and galaxian part X, with emudx support.
    The original sound is not emulated for now, so you'd better use emudx
    samples if you want sound !
  * Editable cheats, usually to select the game stage, are supported again.

raine (0.50.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve slightly yuv overlay rendering, and add support for the yv12
    overlay, used by mpeg cards. It should allow raine to render directly to
    an mpeg card if the picture on screen isn't interlaced !!! It works with
    a pvr350 in linux, just be sure to run ivtvctl --set-yuv-mode=mode=1
    before running raine to avoid interlacing in yuv overlays.
    You can now select your prefered yuv overlay format from the video
    options dialog : don't change this unless you have problems with the
    default YUY2 format (raine will automatically switch to YV12 if YUY2 is
    not hardware accelerated for you).
  * Fix frame skip (automatic and fixed).
  * The game selection dialog now starts with the selection on the currently
    loaded game.
  * dkong and frogger are supported again, with or without emudx. Only
    restriction for now : no alpha blender functions for the flames in dkong,
    I need more time to experiment with this, but it's very playable without
    them anyway ! They both require new emudx sound files, which are about 1Mb
    shorter : dkongm.dx2 and froggerm.dx2.
  * Finally added a game options dialog with "reset game hardware",
    "load/save game" with support for unlimited number of save states,
    "graphical layers", and "cpu frame skip". Also moved the cheats dialog
    here. And you now have complete control over the fps of the game. This is
    the kind of very usefull dialog if you want to control raine with only a
    joystick !
  * Added a savegame converter, from the old allegro format to the new 0.50
    format in the bonus folder (make converter to build it).

raine (0.50.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The cycling colors in the about dialog now really adapt to the number of
    colors of the logo (up to 64 colors, after it's forced to slow down if I
    don't want to make something too complex).
  * The about dialog isn't confused anymore if you invoke it first in a
    windowed mode, and then in fullscreen double buffered.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 19 Jan 2007 03:32:51 +0100

raine (0.50.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix a stupid mistake in the video mode selection (the modes selected were
    always twice too big if using scale2x).
  * Fix the crash in the messagebox for the message about raine logo color 0
    not transparent (if you try to change raine logo). 

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 18 Jan 2007 09:47:55 +0100

raine (0.50.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * double buffer: forced yuv overlay colors when in fullscreen double
    buffered (red & blue could be inverted)
  * double buffer : fixed the crash when using scale2x/3x
  * fix the dlls in windows so that SDL_image and raine use the same dll for
    png.
  * Add some info in the video info dialog about the blit method selected (yuv
    overlay, scale2x, 3x or simple blits).
  * fix very slow gui updates when in fullscreen with a hardware surface
  * Added the mutlipac 1.5 rom (see :
    http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~msilvius/sillyarcade.htm ). Sorry the rom is
    rare, and that's one of the reasons why I added it. The other is because
    it's an impressive hack : 24 games in only 1 z80 rom, I never saw this
    before ! ;-) When you have selected a game in the menu, press P1 start or
    p1 b1 to play it. The hiscores and history are reseted with the game you
    select. To return to the menu, reset raine (F1 is the default control for
    that). So it adds virtualy 24 new games in only 1 rom ;-) !
  * Now raine changes its resolution if you ask it in video options even if it
    uses yuv overlays. It can be usefull to force the yuv overlay to exactly
    2x the size of the original screen for example (to get a clearer picture).
    And it will try to avoid windows biger than the screen in windowed modes.
  * double buffering is now optional, you can disable it in "Video options".
    The default is to use it when available, and normally all the bugs related
    to double buffering are fixed, but anyway, maybe it can be usefull to
    disable it sometimes...
  * Fix the fps counter when the framecount is not limited
  * The return of the sound options dialog, with the addition of the ensoniq
    voice filters option (leave it to yes if you have a fast computer, the
    sound is better with this option turned on).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 17 Jan 2007 11:11:09 +0100

raine (0.50.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed crash in Video info dialog
  * Added "Fullscreen" option, in the video options dialog
  * Fixed double buffering when fullscreen is enabled (windows)
  * Added a messagebox to be able to read the error messages when trying to
    load a game
  * Fixed a few more bugs in the game drivers (like crashing when loading a
    specific game after another)
  * Completely removed the references to yasm in the makefile for the linux
    version.
  * Added a gui options dialog (font, auto-repeat, transparency)
  * Added controls dialogs (emulator & game controls, default & custom)
  * Fixed joystick handliing (only the gamepads could work previously !)
  * Fixed the scrollbars behaviour
  * Added automatic repeat for joystick in the gui (same parameters as the
    keyboard, you can tune them with the gui options dialog).
  * enhanced menu browsing with joystick (left = page up, right = page down,
    and up/down cycles around the list)
  * windows specific : stdout & stderr are used again instead of stdout.txt
    and stderr.txt. This should allow rom utilities to work again with raine.
    Notice that if you want to do that while building your own version of
    raine, then you need to build your own version of sdl with a specific
    parameter to the configure script.
  * New cheats dialog - only allow to enable/disable cheats, not to edit them
    for now. It shows the infos at the bottom of the screen if the cheat has
    some info though (it wasn't done in the allegro version).
  * The return of EmuDX : for now only pacman and Ms Pacman. And all the pengo
    driver has come back with this. Notice : the emudx rendering is compatible
    with the yuv overlays, so you can freely resize the window without any
    problem and choose your prefered size.
  * A very nice new logo for the about dialog from NoLogic (new palette
    cycling code for it !).
  * Finally took the time to fix the "make install" target of the makefile. It
    allows to build a clean debian package again.

raine (0.50.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed all the png mess (colors are now correct for the bezels even if you
    run a game from the command line, and you can now save a screenshot again
    in png - Ctrl S by default now).
  * When resizing a window to keep the aspect ratio, always resize within the
    size chosen by the user (to avoid to have a window bigger than the
    screen!)
  * Acrobat Mission, black heart, and macross2 are loadable again
  * Fixed the 8bpp games
  * Added quite a few options to the game selection dialog
  * Fixed the crash in thunder fox (since 0.42 or 0.43 - the automatic calling
    of make_solid_region).
  * Fixed allocation of m6585 sound chip which crashed gcpinbal when reseting
    the game (very, very old bug).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Mon,  1 Jan 2007 20:53:53 +0100

raine (0.50.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The major new thing in 0.50 is I got finally rid of allegro and its
    endless bugs. Now SDL is used for everything, and there is a whole new
    gui. New savegame format, also.
  * fix the glitches in strider (since 0.42)
  * Fix path /usr/usr in "make install" for linux !!!
  * fix champwr freezing at start of game... this one is from 0.38 !!! (I
    think I didn't want to fix this bug at a time... well it was a long time
    ago !)
  * Restored task force harrier title screen, it was wiped out when some other
    games in this driver were fixed. Still not playable.
  * Fixed colors in some seta games (like zombie raid)
  * Some games were loading their roms twice before
  * TODO : check bankswitch for these games :
     exzisus.c
     rambo3.c
     viofight.c
     lsystem.c
     xsystem2.c

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 16 Aug 2006 22:52:35 +0200

raine (0.43.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix bad bg layer in seta games since the new automatic sprites handling
    in 0.43.x.
  * Robiza updated these sets to the latest mame versions : ainferno,
    downtown, contcirc, and many others... also he added the latest cps1/cps2
    clones from mame.
  * Force auto-detection of joystick and sound in linux and windows *ALWAYS*
    (config file is ignored for that now)
  * -romcheck/-rc is now much faster, because the games are not loaded anymore
    the zip files are just opened to check the crcs. It's much enough for a
    normal setup, and way faster than loading the games. Use -rcf if you want
    a full check as before (which will detect more errors only if you load
    your games unzipped, or if there is a bad sector in one of your zip
    files!)
  * In windows & linux, don't synchronize anymore using the rdtsc. This is to
    work around features like "cool and quiet", or cpufreq which allow modern
    cpus to lower their frequency when they have no need to be fast.
    The rdtsc is still used for the profiler display though (F11 key).
    We now use code adapted from SDL_gfx to sync. It's tested when the game
    is droping frames and it seems to be perfect everywhere.
  * Pressing P to play doesn't put the game directly in pause mode anymore!
  * Fix the bad sound in contcirc (actually I just muted it, because I didn't
    find the cause !). Same thing for darius2do.
  * Work around the Microsoft® Digital Media Pro Keyboard being detected as a
    joystick (at least in linux, don't know if it's the case in windows). All
    inputs enabled when opening the joystick dialog are simply ignored now (it
    reports some axis moved all the time).
  * Added Steering wheel/Pedals support to continental circus (choose Cabinet:
    Cockpit in the dsw to use this - I didn't add any calibration for the
    steering wheel, and I tested this with the one from gran turismo 3 !).
  * These games can now run in any color depth : continental circus, battle
    shark, chase hq, darius, darius2do, aqua jack
  * When you launch a game by the command line, you can now give any dir name
    instead of the short game name. For example "cybattler" or "darius_gaiden"
    are now recognized.
  * Fix again the sound in darius2 (not darius2do).
  * The debian package installs correctly its data files in
    /usr/share/games/raine and not /usr/share/raine as in 0.43.3

raine (0.43.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix compilation errors in xorg, and with versions of allegro which don't
    define GFX_XWINDOWS_FULLSCREEN. Also this one works with gcc-4, no more
    errors about movl.
  * Apply patch from Antiriad which adds fix eight bootleg
  * Basic dependencies support in the makefile, so that at least the
    compilation doesn't stop with 2 pages of error messages just because
    we forgot to install a lib (liballeg, sdl and allegro tested).

raine (0.43.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * use only -O1 for the optimizations in linux too :
    with -O4 it crashes dfeveron after the copyright screen (gcc4)
    and with gcc-3.4 you get a black screen when starting any game.
    All these are fixed by -O1, so I switch to -O1 for now (this is already
    the case for the windows version).

raine (0.43.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix the stupid segfault in multchmp (it crashes only the windows and dos
    version apparently !)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue, 20 Sep 2005 22:28:05 +0200

raine (0.43.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Haze added diverboy, mugsmash, cross pang.
  * I added Jumping pop, and Tetris 2+ (or fixed it since there was a
    preliminary driver in raine since 0.28, but it was really the begining).
    I also added the esd16 driver from mame, with multi champ, multi champ
    deluxe, and head panic. All of these are using lots of colors !
  * A few fixes for extreme video modes situations (linux console). WARNING:
    if you want to play with the frame buffer in linux, use allegro 4.2.0,
    frame buffer support has been broken for a very long time in
    allegro-4.1.x.
  * Also some fixes to really prevent raine from changing the current video
    mode if the user forbids it or if the current video driver can't give
    the list of supported video modes by the monitor (which is the case of
    frame buffer driver for linux).
  * Bezel fixes : when the video mode is not automatically changed, the bezel
    now adapts to the current mode (instead of not displaying anything).
    Also if you load a 2nd game which also uses a bezel, the 2nd bezel is now
    correctly handled.
  * The buffer for the history.dat is doubled (for dkong for example), I
    should probably use a dynamic buffer for that... maybe later.
  * Now raine supports multiple layouts / gfx layers, and is automatically
    calling make_solid_mask for a region when a layout is defined for it.
    gfx[n] always contains the nth layer in the layouts list, and gfx_solid[n]
    is the result of the call of make_solid_mask on this region, and
    max_sprites[n] contains the number of sprites for this area.
    Also the driver's loading function is now called BEFORE the layouts are
    applied, which allows to decrypt/convert the sprites and still use
    automatically the layers. This should have been added a long time ago, it
    became obvious just recently with all these drivers which needed manual
    graphics decoding.
  * raine does its own tests for svgalib in linux now. If it does not detect
    vga.h at the standard places when compiling, then svgalib support is
    disabled.
  * Fixed the fg layer of the 2nd tc100scn not updated in thundfox (thundfox
    seems to be the only game which uses a 2nd fg layer, so it escaped me !)
  * while testing stuff with the eeproms, fixed pang3j which never worked (!),
    and added service mode controls for the pirates driver.
  * fine tune the music of the hammer in donkey kong so that the other sounds
    can be heared while it's playing.

    hyperpac driver : twinkle, Xess - The New Revolution (Semicom 3-in-1),
    more more, final tetris.
    cookbib driver : Cookie and Bibi, Hatch Catch, Choky Choky.
    I fixed the dipswitches, and for final tetris the sound and the inputs.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Mon, 29 Aug 2005 16:22:57 +0200

raine (0.43.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new games : Pang, Super Pang, Poker ladies, Block Block.
    All of them playable with sound, adapted from mame.

  * Added sound support to these games based on the nmk004 findings in mame:
    macross, black heart, bio ship paladin, strahl, acrobat mission, mustang,
    thunder dragon, and even hacha mecha fighter but this one is still totally
    unplayable.

    For mustang, I switched to mustang original set instead of the bootleg
    version to avoid the infamous seibu sound system, so you'll have to update
    your romsets.
    Congratulations go to the mame team for that, everyone has been wondering
    how this sound emulation worked for YEARS !
  * Fixed the file size recorded in the wav files, when recording
    raine_soud.wav, and the alignement byte which prevented the sound to play
    in the microsoft media player ! The wav file format is probably one of the
    stupidest file formats ever invented !
  * add the ability to save screenshots in png (default now). You can set the
    compression level by editing the configuration file. Also you can now use
    a png file for the raine default background picture !
  * Add a new command to save a "video", or more exactly a sequence of
    screenshots (preferably in png), and at the same time a wav file. You will
    still need something like mplayer to merge everything together.
    See README.videos in the docs directory for the details.
  * fixed sound not starting when loading a saved game before qsound has been
    initalised in the capcom games (also fix a few stupid bank switches here
    and there).
  * When choosing the best video resolution if all the available resolutions
    where too small, then you got a ridiculously small resolution. Now you get
    the bigest one.
  * Added artwork bezel support - see README.bezels in the docs directory.
  * Fixed bad sound in bjtwin and sabotenb, now there are no cracks any more.
  * Fix a very old bug where the default directories for screen_dir
    (snapshots) and roms became "", translated to "/". I never noticed it
    because I always use the same config...
  * Fix a 1 pixel alignement issue for the text layer in do donpachi (I never
    noticed it before because I usually don't have time to read the text in
    dodonpachi ! I finally saw it because I recorded a video in dodonpachi!).
  * For windows choose a windowed default video mode to avoid any problem with
    weird setups which have vido sync problems. For the other OSes, choose a
    default resolution based on the video modes really available, take the 1st
    from 320x240.
  * dx2 emudx file format : graphics for emudx are now stored in .dx2 files,
    which should be available from rainemu.com. These files are smaller than
    the original .dx files (and it's more convinient to work with these). The
    emudx files can now be placed either in the main raine directory for
    compatibility or in the emudx sub directory. .dx files are not supported
    anymore for the graphics.
  * Added hammer music to donkey kong... It's generated from a midi file, oh
    well, if someone can do something better, let me know !
  * Unix behaviour : a long time ago I accepted a patch to make raine to use a
    personnal dir, and a system wide dir for its files in linux, but I never
    took the time to test this since I have always used only 1 dir for raine.
    Well, it didn't work, raine always used one of these 2 instead of trying
    the personnal dir first and then the system wide directory. It's now fixed
    for raine.dat, hiscore.dat, history.dat, the snapshots, the language
    files, and the bezels.

  * Improved priority bitmap emulation (faster and more precise) for cps2 and
    the cave driver.
  * Add rom region switches for mshh and mpangj (translated), and vhunt2r1
    and vsav2 (only partially translated, but the service mode is translated
    at least).
  * Added a speed hack for mpangj
  * Fix bad color palette for snapshots in the gui in 16bpp sometimes

raine (0.42.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed REGION_EMPTY not supported anymore for games like arkanoid bootleg.
    This bug was probably due to the new way of handling clones when loading
    roms (added in 0.40.5) (helped from loading the rom).
  * Save a little more memory for cps1 & cps2 (on scroll1).
  * Try much harder to reset game hardware when a f3 game hangs after its
    eeprom has been reseted. With this we should definetely get rid of the
    "game xyz hangs when I launch it" messages in the forums.
  * Fix levels order in dkong us (this should be the last time !).
  * Add speed hacks for 19xx and dimahoo (not sure if it's usefull or not, but
    now these games won't be limited by the cpu power...).
  * Fix music speed for cps2 (it was slightly too slow, check sgemf when it
    displays "no mercy"...).
  * Fix a very old bug in the speed hack allocations for cps1 & cps2, it
    showed only in an sgemf background during attract mode afaik.
  * Try a new way of handling the priorities for cps2. This is not the mame
    way. It's faster, but I am not sure it works everywhere, it's much better
    than what we had in 0.42.0 anyway.
  * Fixed compilation with allegro-4.0.x for fedora core (linux).
  * Added new game : nostradamus, fully playable (it was to test the oddities
    of the mcatadv driver...).

raine (0.42.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the last sound issues in cps2 (in fact it was just the data bank of
    the z80 which was not loaded correctly), and added a few cps2 games to
    play with. Video priorities are still not emulated, but the result is
    quite good actually !!!
  * Improved the starscream patch for gigawing, and add all the real cps2
    games from mame (no clones).
  * Improve sprites decoding in cps1/cps2 to save memory. The memory saved is
    quite impressive, but 19xx and dimahoo still require about 70 Mb (120 Mb
    before !!!).
  * Fix a possible buffer overflow in history.dat handling (there was one for
    mvsc) and expand the history.dat buffer to 8kb.

  * Fixed flames glowing in dkong (quick fix, using the allegro alpha blending
    functions - can probably be improved).
  * Fixed sprites not showing in late stages of mazinger
  * Fixed sprites priorities in cave driver (in fact rewrote the whole
    priority code for the cave driver, now using only the priority bitmap).
    Now you can finally read the text in the end of dodonpachi and see
    some new gfx effects in the intro of dfeveron, and feversos, and there
    are probably some more changes...
  * Fixed inputs not working for player 2 in guwange (quite a shame that this
    one was never finden earlier !!!).

raine (0.41.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * frogger samples updates :
     - coin sample is now louder
     - game over and all home sound now much better thanks to old original
     files found by Mike.
     - Added a new tune when you loose a life, from one of these old files.

raine (0.41.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * When loading dkongjp after dkong, the levels were still drawn for dkong.
    It's fixed now.
  * pacman and mspacman now have big flashing power pills ! :)
  * pacman/mspacman : fruits on the bottom of screen match fruits in the
    level!
  * Applied patch from Ville Skytta to have language files in lower case
    (after all only dos/windows is case insensitive, all the serious OS in the
    world are case sensitive ! :))
  * Fixed the colour of the gun in opwolf and zombie raid (and every game
    actually using the gun) for color depths > 8 (bug related to changes for
    the sdl video driver).
  * Fixed sound card name (SDL <Not initialised yet> was displayed in the
    sound driver selection dialog).

raine (0.41.0-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the handling of dx samples to a new sound driver (dxsmp.c). It was
    necessary to have a precision of 1 frame with buggy windows sound drivers
    which must work with big sound buffers for the updates.
  * Fixed a bug when loading dkong after mspacmab.

raine (0.41.0-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the missing sprite of the purple frog in frogger

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat,  4 Sep 2004 15:22:20 +0200

raine (0.41.0-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * the roars at when the game starts and when a level ends are now emulated
    in dkong (2 roars instead of 3 because dx roars last longer !).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat,  4 Sep 2004 10:33:31 +0200

raine (0.41.0-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * dx samples status is now saved in savegames, and they stop when you reset
    the game hardware.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat,  4 Sep 2004 10:01:28 +0200

raine (0.41.0-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * added donkey kong (us and japan versions), with dx samples and dx graphics.
  * Fixed arpro search on games using a Z80 as cpu 0, and removed the
    obligation to have -1,-1 in the z80 memory map for the searches to work
    (-1,-1 serves nothing by itself, whereas 0,0xffff, DefBadReadByte is
    always there).

raine (0.41.0-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * emudx samples now work in sdl, and I took back the musics from the dx
    samples with volume adustements.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sun, 29 Aug 2004 20:53:24 +0200

raine (0.41.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the synchronisation method for the sdl sound driver. The new method
    uses more efficiently the callback, better results in windows and shorter
    and much easier code.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 28 Aug 2004 23:04:02 +0200

raine (0.41.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a problem with cheats/hiscore on games using exactly 2 z80s frogger,
    for example

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 27 Aug 2004 11:40:31 +0200

raine (0.41.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Prevent emudx to change resolution when it's not necessary (related to
    color depth)
  * Finally converted the dx characters in frogger to retrieve their originol
    colours. Quite crazy !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 26 Aug 2004 13:33:34 +0200

raine (0.41.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a "Pac-man/Pengo" driver name in the driver selection menu for the
    game selection dialog (it allows to quickly spot the new pacman hacks).
  * Took back the fix for the allegro gui bug where the menu is frozen if
    raine is linked with allegro-4.0.x. But this time test allegro version we
    were compiled with before applying the work around (usefull in debian
    where they use allegro 4.0.x which is supposed to be stable).
    This work around disables dialog solid movements (no blits).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 26 Aug 2004 11:05:25 +0200

raine (0.41.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Frogger : fix layer alignement and replacement of layer tiles by big 32x32
    sprites.
  * Disable ansi sequences in windows (stupid windows still does not support
    ansi sequences natively, what a shame !!!).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 26 Aug 2004 10:25:29 +0200

raine (0.41.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added emudx support for frogger (graphics and sound). Kept the ay8910 for
    music.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 25 Aug 2004 23:59:48 +0200

raine (0.41.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added frogger, playable without sound (will try to add only emudx sound,
    these filters used by frogger for sound look like a real mess !)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue, 24 Aug 2004 16:47:24 +0200

raine (0.41.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added sstriker, european translation of mahoudai (toaplan2)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Mon, 23 Aug 2004 20:42:11 +0200

raine (0.41.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a few default intialisations the first time raine is launched,
    especially for win32. Now :
     - the displayed video mode is correct in windows (there was a bug with
     the autodetect video driver...)
     - switch to 16bpp by default for xwindows and windows.
     - chooses allegmix sound driver by default in win32 (back to allegro)
     - the list of displayed games is "available" by default.
     - emudx init now always forces 16bpp (allegro was wrongly reporting 8bpp
     as the depth of the bitmaps in the archive if the current video mode was
     in 8bpp !)
     - Games which now request 16bpp switch color depth to 16bpp if they are
     currently in 32bpp (it's for emudx support which absolutely requires
     16bpp and can't work in 32bpp).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Mon, 23 Aug 2004 08:42:10 +0200

raine (0.41.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added complete alpha blending support (mmx code based on an article found
    on the web). For now it works only for 32x32 sprites but it can easily be
    adapted to any size.
  * Put back windows to allegmix sound driver, and put the linux sound driver
    to its normal defaults as in 0.40.4. Windows sound drivers (at least those
    from creative) do not respect specs, which makes sdl sound delay
    corrections very hard. And on the other hand the allegro sound driver is
    unreliable in linux. So this is the easiest solution.
  * Bugs found : when raine is first installed in windows, it wrongly believes
    it's using the accelerated driver when it uses the autodetect driver which
    makes color depth changes impossible. I should really remove completely
    this autodetect thing one day. The autodetect driver in sdl is a miracle,
    and in allegro it's a nightmare !!! But this bug will probably stay where
    it is for quite a while, I hate windows, and I don't want to spend time on
    it.

raine (0.41.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added some preliminary alpha blending drawing functions for the ghosts in
    pacman ! For now the alpha blending is locked at 50%, which makes the
    ghosts a little dark... but at least it's fast !!!

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 21:14:19 +0200

raine (0.40.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added emudx support for pacman/puckman and mspacmab :-) !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 08:32:27 +0200

raine (0.40.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed pacman savestates to save irq status (it allows to load a game
    without having to wait for the machine to initialize).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 19 Aug 2004 00:32:21 +0200

raine (0.40.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * added yet another hack : Xen's revenge (very hard !)
    Fixed pacman dsw, and improved the "2x speed cheat" from mame's idea
    (using button 1 to enable it or not, after having enabled the cheat from
    the dsw).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 18 Aug 2004 11:39:47 +0200

raine (0.40.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new game hacks : mspacpls, mspac6m, pacman3d, and namcosil.
    Also raine now uses clones of clones as it should always have (since it's
    the main purpose of the DIR_INFO struct : allowing recursion !). It makes
    the ROM_INFO structs even shorter now !
    
 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue, 17 Aug 2004 22:51:37 +0200

raine (0.40.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from Ville Skytta (optional svgalib build in linux + ansi
    colors slightly different)
  * Try to detect when stdout is redirected to a file and disable ansi colors
    in this case (use isatty, but isatty does not seem to be available in
    windows... what a surprise !)
  * The clones do not repeat the regions of the parent anymore.
    When a region is the same it is simply not listed, and raine checks the
    parent automatically now. If you want the region to be empty, you have to
    tell it explicitely by using REGION_EMPTY (see arkanoid.c for an example).
    It makes shorter source code, and makes it easier to maintain too. It
    fixes the bad snowbros clones in 0.40.5 by the way.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Mon, 16 Aug 2004 18:09:02 +0200

raine (0.40.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enough of fixes for raine-0.40.5

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sun,  8 Aug 2004 14:56:46 +0200

raine (0.40.4-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lots of games which are requiring 8bpp now automtically set the screen to
    8bpp if it is in a different color depth when you load them.
  * Buble Boble is now playable in any color depth.
  * Running Pulirula and then loading rastan does not crash raine anymore.
    Also this fix will probably improve the stability when loading a few games
    which are using the tc100scn video chip.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sun,  8 Aug 2004 01:02:27 +0200

raine (0.40.4-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Running a toaplan2 game like dogyuun, and then a cave game like donpachi
    works normally now.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 20:16:36 +0200

raine (0.40.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix ym3812 timer. Now demon's world, snow bros and quite a few others are
    playable again... By the way snowbros now uses the new mame set.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 12:58:33 +0200

raine (0.40.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade Chuka Taisen to use the latest mame set (b44.12 was changed to
    b44.12w, but I ignore the reason). 

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 10:29:50 +0200

raine (0.40.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed ballbros/twinhawk when raine was compiled in debug mode (there was a
    ++ in a print_debug, what a shame !!!)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 10:04:37 +0200

raine (0.40.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix tc0100scn emulation for "asuka & asuka", and opwolf.
  * Fixed c-chip for opwolf (ingame and reset game).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri,  6 Aug 2004 17:55:44 +0200

raine (0.40.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a few drivers with sound too loud in sdl (matmania, arkanoid...)
  * Fixed noise channel not working for the ay8910 (in matmania for example).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri,  6 Aug 2004 13:08:01 +0200

raine (0.40.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The SDL video is starting to work. No gui yet, but already hardware
    accelerated overlays when supported.
  * Raine now uses ANSI sequences to write text in color to the console.
    It allows to get RAINE in the colors of the old dos version in any linux
    or windows terminal !
  * Fixed cpu capabilities detection, and add rdtsc detection.
  * Forced sound buffer length to 2048 samples for sdl, since this is all
    what quite a few soundblaster windows drivers can handle (a pity).
    Anyway, it does not seem to create any bad delay, but it needs more
    testing. 

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri,  6 Aug 2004 10:51:08 +0200

raine (0.40.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved again sound synchronization for SDL (it's just more responsive,
    which can be helpfull on slow systems which drop frames). There is still a
    bug with some win2k versions though wich seem to require transfers of 4096
    bytes in my_callback, which represents about 6 sound frams, and which
    makes synchronization very hard. For now the only reliable solution with
    this win2k problem is to use the allegro sound driver.
  * Also improved sound emulation speed : the stream_update function in
    streams.c does not seem to make the emulation more precise, but it
    definetely makes it slower, so I just reverted to the old behaviour, it
    does nothing anymore.
  * Fixed controls in sf2ce clones (sf2m4, m5, m6, etc...).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 12 Jun 2004 16:04:12 +0200

raine (0.40.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved sound synchronization, it now can jump or drop more than 1 frame,
  and it can follow when one of the points is at the begin of the buffer while
  the other is at the end. It fixes the sound in all taito f3 games.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue,  8 Jun 2004 08:32:05 +0200

raine (0.40.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

    default location to load the hiscore.dat and history.dat file.
